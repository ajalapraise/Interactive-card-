## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Vanilla Javascript by Brad traversy(Youtube) & Brian Holt (frontend masters)


### What I learned

I learnt how to use RedEx in Javascript to make coding easier and simpler to understand.
Understading further how to use a form tag and style it

<!-- To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
} 
```
-->




### Continued development

Learn DOM manipulation well, APIs, and work on using frameworks especially reactJs
